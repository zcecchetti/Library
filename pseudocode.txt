create book object that has attributes of author, page number, book name,
whether its been read or not, and optionally notes (optional as in optional 
for me to add this feature).

Then create a function that allows the user to create a new instance of the 
book object and stores each instance in an array

after this, there should be a function that displays each object in the array
on the webpage in the form of a "card"

a button may be pressed on each card that will switch the boolean "read" value

one last function should allow the user to delete a book from the array and remove
it from being displayed on the page.
